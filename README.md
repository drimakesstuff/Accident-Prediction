## **🔹 Features**

-Data Cleaning & Preparation – Handles missing values and removes summary rows.

-Prediction – Estimates fatalities for 2019–2020 based on trends from 2016–2018.

-Age-wise Visualization – Subplots for each age group showing historical & predicted deaths.
-total Fatalities – Automatically calculates overall predicted deaths across all age groups.

## **🚀 How to Use**

1. **Clone the repository**:
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/drimakesstuff/Accident-Prediction.git

```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```
bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```

3. **Open the notebook**:
```
bash

jupyter notebook Road_Accidents_Analysis.ipynb
Run cells to explore data, train models, and generate visualizations.
```

## **📊 Visualization**

-**Each age group has its own subplot**:

1.2016–2018 → Actual fatalities
2.2019–2020 → Predicted fatalities

Trends are displayed with lines and markers for easy comparison.

## **Insights **
Across all the plots, the story is basically that younger teens are getting safer on the roads, adults in their late twenties and early thirties remain the highest-risk group with a steady climb, middle-aged people split between a mild decline (35–45) and a gradual rise (45–60), and older adults show a bouncy but generally increasing trend, while the “age not known” category is clearly messy reporting rather than a real pattern; overall it suggests shifting risk toward active, commuting-age adults and an aging population becoming more vulnerable.
